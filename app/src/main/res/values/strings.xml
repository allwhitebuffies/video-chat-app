    <string name="about">This is a video shuffling app that was made for an Information Security project.
    In order to use this app, you must sign in with a trusted social media outlet (e.g. FaceBook, Google+, etc.).
    Our original plan for this app was to match users based on specific criteria (e.g. location, interests, gender, etc.).
    It took us longer to build the basic framework for this app than we had planned, and due to this class projects nature,
    had to cut out several of our ideas. This app has a lot of potential and we would love to continue working on it
    after we turn it in for our class. We would love to hear your feedback. Thanks for downloading!</string>
